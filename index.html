<p class="info">Samantha to the power of Callie, also known as just Samantha Callie if you're boring, is an experimental glitchhop electroswing rap dumbstep pop rocks metal band formed at the beginning of all things. Our numbers are unavailable to the public, but we <em>can</em> tell you it's past the threshold of a national security risk. Did you know that no one Callie plays the same instrument? Many of them are one of a kind, such as the ever famous thereharptar. Stay tuned for concerts near you, whether on stage or in that room you swore never to go into again.</p>
